# time_tracker
Timetracker that will track the time spent looking at different windows on windows. It will have 3 different parts. The tracker that just collects raw data, a script that analyses the data and converts it into something more useful for the user, and finally some sort of graphical data visualizer for the user to better understand the data. 

### Parts

##### Data-collection
A simple script done that only works on windows. Maybe on other platforms in the future.

##### Data-analysis
Only at planning stage. I don't see this being too difficult

##### Data visualiser
UI stuff generally seems to be pretty hard. I'd imagine this to be the hardest part since I don't really have any experience with making UI with python or in general.
